When typing in the right filter search field, the best match (selected by smartcmp) should be selected and the webview should scroll to its anchor
Should be able to use up/down arrow keys while filter bar search field is first responder to navigate the filter bar
The webview shouldn't scroll when resizing: Let x be the number of pixels to the nearest anchor, then x should be invariant when resizing.
Needs key combos for selecting the next and previous method in the webview
Switch to smartcmp algorithm
    Implement frecency
    Implement docset prioritization
Back/forward button menus should include icons
Loads of articles don't parse properly, but thankfully the main ones do
